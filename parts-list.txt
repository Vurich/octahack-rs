Bindings:
Keyset:
  32 keys on keyboard
  Fn key (toggle/hold for fn mode)
  Shift key (hold for alt functions)
  Alt key (toggle/hold for alt mode)
  3 contactless sliders
  8 rotary encoders plus pushbutton

2 modes active at a time, by default this is normal mode (select components, shift to wire) and edit file mode (sequencer for midi files, audio editor for audio files). Switch between them by holding or tapping the alt key (hold + using a control returns you to the previous mode when you let go, tap toggles you into that alt mode).
Edit mode edits the file for the most-recently-accessed file parameter, or the first one if none have ever been
accessed.

Normal: keyboard maps to nth component
  Hold shift: select input/output. First half of keyboard maps to inputs, second half to outputs.
              Key is red = unwired, key is green = wired. Screen displays what the meaning of each
              I/O is. The key pulses with light to show that input/output's value (lowest value is
              still a dim glow). Pressing a key goes into wire mode, or if we're already in wire
              mode it ends that wire by connecting the I/O to the I/O that we selected when we
              entered wire mode. Pressing a knob will go into wire mode to wire that param to an
              output.

              Turning a rotary encoder while in wire mode will change the "wire value" for that
              parameter - the value the parameter will take when the output is at its maximum
              value. Pressing N while in wire mode deletes that wire, pressing Y or pressing the
              same param/input/output again while in wire mode exits wire mode keeping the current
              wire in place.
Hold fn: keyboard maps to special functions - akin to the space bar in spacemacs
Tap fn: toggle the keyboard to/from special function mode. The functions available depends on the 
        currently-active mode, but some are always available like keypress quantisation.
Tap rotary encoder: "special select" mode for that option. Meaning depends on option. For files
                    it opens the file slot selection window, for a frequency option it might
                    allow fine control plus using other knobs to choose note vs raw freq, for
                    a time option it might allow enabling/disabling choose beat/fraction of beat vs
                    choose seconds, etc.

Hold rotary encoder + rotate: fast change - increases speed of changing options
In function mode, rotary encoders are shortcuts to certain options. Shift + press that rotary encoder
while in function mode puts you into a mode where pressing the next rotary encoder will map that shortcut to
the respective param.
Function mode functions (incomplete list):
  Quantise next command to some number of beats
Shift plus selecting a function mode function will, for many functions, "lock" that function. For
example, for quantise next command it will quantise _all_ commands until you deselect quantisation.

3 sliders, 1 is for scenes (TODO: Should this be configurable?) and the other 2 are just rack inputs that can
be wired to anything (v/o, params, etc).

At any time N (for no) is a kind of "escape" or "panic" key, taking you back to the default state. Sometimes it
acts as "no option", for example if you're in "set key quantisation" mode and press N, it will choose no key
quantisation.
